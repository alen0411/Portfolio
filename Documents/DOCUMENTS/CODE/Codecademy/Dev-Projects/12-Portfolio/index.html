                                Hi! My name is Alen and for the past 7 years I have been working as an Architect.
                                While building design is very interesting, I have always been fascinated and passionate by computer science and technology. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Last year I decided to make a big change and transition my carrer into a Front End Web Developer.
                                I started my research online, from viewing tutorials on YouTube to lectures like CS50, which inspired me even more on my new path.
                                Shortly after, I had enrolled in an online Codecademy FE Developer course to obtain a deeper knowledge and overview of my new field and future profession.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being halfway through my course, I am enjoying every Bit of it and I am looking forward to completing it and soon start working as a Front End Developer. 
                            </p>
